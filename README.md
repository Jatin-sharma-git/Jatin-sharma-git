> I automate the boring stuff so people can focus on what actually matters. From PDF processing to AI-powered email parsing — if it's repetitive, I'll script it away.

### 💡 Philosophy

```
"If you're doing it more than twice, automate it."
```

I believe the best tools are the ones that disappear into the background — they just work. Every automation I build starts with one question: *"What's the most painful part of this workflow?"* — then I eliminate it.
